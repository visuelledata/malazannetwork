# Abstract
```{marginfigure, echo=TRUE}
Note: All bolded words are hyperlinks. 
```
In this project, I attempt to find the climaxes of the series [**Malazan Book of the Fallen**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malazan_Book_of_the_Fallen) by using network data and sentiment analysis. This series is notable in that it is one of the most complex and long fantasy series with a continuous single plot-line. There are `r num_words` words in the series and I estimated that there are at least `r num_char()[[1]]` characters in the series with approximately `r num_pov` unique points of view. Additionally, many of the characters have multiple aliases and nicknames adding another layer of complexity. A character might go by completely different names in different novels.

I began by mining the co-occurrence data from the ngrams; I used a combination of regular expressions, parallelization, and more. I'll elaborate more on that process later. From there, I had to get the co-occurrence data into a reasonable format and clean the name data. I then used the AFINN Lexicon to get the sentiment data. Finally, I compared the sentiment data with the network data to try to see which works better to determine the climax of each of the 10 books. 

```{marginfigure echo=TRUE}
The AFINN Lexicon contains 2,476 words with negativity and positivity scores between -5 and 5. 
```

# Introduction

The goal of this study was to use network and sentiment analysis to find the climax of each book in the series. I used numerous datasets from several sources in this project. The co-occurrence data was mined from the books by me. The books were converted from `.epub` format to `.txt` format. I made most of the `alias` data manually and crowd-sourced some of the aliases on [**Reddit**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Malazan/comments/alaknz/spoilers_what_are_aliases_are_there_in_this_series/). The `name` data was manually extracted from the *Dramatis Personae* sections at the start of each book and manually extracted from the [**Malazan Wiki**](https://malazan.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Males). 

To mine the character co-occurrence data, I started by converting `epub` versions of the novels to `.txt` files and reading them into R. Then I added book numbers, chapter numbers, and stripped the front and back matter from each book. From there, I turned the text into a series of ngrams of length 20 split by book and chapter. At this point, I wrote a function that extracts the characters' names from the ngrams by row and then puts the co-occurrence data into a workable format. Cleaning and formatting the co-occurrence data was the next step. Finally, I used a variety of methods to find the climaxes of each book. 

# Method and results

## Method
I'll begin this section with a detailed description of the methods and assumptions I used in mining the character names from the novels as that was the most difficult part of the project. 

I began by joining the character name data with the alias data into a single dataset. I then split all of this data by spaces in order to get variations of the names and rejoined the partial name data back to the full name data to get a comprehensive dataset of full and partial names. I then filtered out stop words, formal titles, military ranks, and commonly capitalized words that aren't names from this list. Then, I arranged the list by character length.

At this point, I went back to the book data and turned the text into ngrams of length 20 by book and chapter. I chose to use ngrams so that I would get the full co-occurrence relations within the 20 word groups. For example, "Ron Jon" then "Ron Jon Bob" and finally "Jon Bob". Then I wrote a function that tries to extract every name in the name list from the ngram. If there is a match, then it also removes the match from the string for subsequent iterations. Otherwise, "Brys Beddict" would be extracted 3 times. 
```{marginfigure echo=TRUE}
Some of the code for this process will be shown in the appendix. 
```

This method of extraction was incredibly computationally intensive as there were 3,080 names in my name list and 3,250,530 ngrams. My code went through multiple iterations, and I eventually added parallelization and broke my data into 263 chunks. All of this managed to get my code to run in around 40 hours on my laptop. The original speed was about 310 seconds per 1600 ngrams, and I reduced that to approximately 70 seconds per 1600. These speeds are what I recall. Initially, I did not think to record them. Most of the improvement was due to the parallelization and an `if` statement before the `str_extract_all` call. I attached the code for this part in the appendix. 

Once the co-occurrence data was in a usable format, I had a significant amount of data cleaning to do. Much of the data cleaning was due to the fact that there were partial name matches due to the use of ngrams "John Smith" matched as "John", and due to the fact that some characters have up to 9 different names. My job was made easier by the fact that less important characters tend to have fewer names in the series, such as Mallet, Picker, or Antsy whose surnames are never revealed. I formatted and removed variations of all names with over 100 appearances in the network data. I used over 130 regular expressions to achieve this. I made three assumptions at this stage:
```{marginfigure echo=TRUE}
Note, when I use the word "importance"  I am generally talking about something with a high centrality measure. 
```

* The names with over 100 occurrences in the co-occurrence data, in addition to the uncleaned names of the less featured characters are sufficient to fully represent the true co-occurrence network. 
*  The most common variations of names accurately represent the co-occurrence relationships of their specific character. 
* Any extremely uncommon name variations will be filtered out as isolated nodes or removed by a small filter on a centrality measure.  
 
After cleaning the data, I began to analyze the co-occurrence data. 

## Results

I'll jump right into it by giving the top 10 most important characters using PageRank compared with their degree centrality importance. I only used un-directed network graphs for everything that follows. 
```{r}
as_tbl_graph(network_data, directed = FALSE) %>% 
  mutate(pop_deg = centrality_degree(), 
         pop_pr = centrality_pagerank()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(pop_deg)) %>% 
  mutate(rank_degree = 1:1493) %>% 
  arrange(desc(pop_pr)) %>% 
  mutate(rank_pagerank = 1:1493) %>% 
  as.tibble() %>% 
  select(-pop_deg, -pop_pr) %>% 
  head(10) %>% 
  knitr::kable(col.names = c("Character", "Ranking - Degree Centrality", "Ranking - PageRank"))
```

Degree centrality and PageRank mostly agree on the most important characters in the series, but they start to greatly diverge the further they get away from the top 10. As shown in the figure to the right. 
```{r fig.margin=TRUE}
as_tbl_graph(network_data, directed = FALSE) %>% 
  mutate(pop_deg = centrality_degree(), 
         pop_pr = centrality_pagerank()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(pop_deg)) %>% 
  mutate(rank_degree = 1:1493) %>% 
  arrange(desc(pop_pr)) %>% 
  mutate(rank_pagerank = 1:1493) %>%
  ggplot(aes(rank_degree, rank_pagerank)) + 
  geom_line(color = "grey25") + 
  labs(subtitle = "Rankings of degree and PageRank centrality",  
       x = "Ranking from degree centrality", y = "Ranking from PageRank") + 
  theme_ipsum() 
```

In the following network graph, I used PageRank to calculate the centrality because I don't feel that degree centrality is as suitable for this network.  

```{r results='asis', fig.fullwidth=TRUE,out.width="450px"}
# Code for full graph
# pallette <-  RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(10, "Set3")
# as_tbl_graph(network_data, directed = FALSE) %>%
#   mutate(popularity = centrality_pagerank()) %>%
#   arrange(desc(popularity)) %>% 
#   mutate(rank = row_number()) %>% 
#   filter(!node_is_isolated()) %>%
#   activate(edges) %>% 
#   mutate(book = as.integer(book)) %>% 
#   arrange(book) %>%
#   mutate(book = as.factor(book)) %>% 
#   distinct(from, to, book, chapter) %>% 
#   ggraph(layout = "nicely") +
#   geom_edge_link(aes(color = book)) +
#   geom_node_point(aes(size = popularity^2.5), color = "grey20") +
#   theme_void() +
#   theme(legend.position="none") +
#   scale_color_manual(values = pallette)
#cat('\n')
knitr::include_graphics("full-network-graph.png")
#cat('\n')
#cat('\n![](full-network-graph.png)\n')
```

\newpage
The only interesting observation I can make from this graph is that there is a distinction between the two main continents from the 4 first books in the series and the third main continent introduced in book 5. Also, these groups become more connected in books 7, 8, 9, and 10. 

```{r}
sentiment_scores <- books %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, line) %>% 
  inner_join(get_sentiments("afinn")) %>% 
  group_by(book, chapter) %>% 
  summarize(score = sum(score)) %>% 
  ungroup()
```

Before I begin trying to find the best way to indicate the climaxes in the series, I'll check if a chapter's sentiment score is correlated with importance. I initially thought that either of them could be used to predict climaxes on their own and that they may be correlated. The importance of the chapters was calculated by taking the mean of the edge betweenness centrality values of all of the edges in each chapter. 

```{r fig.margin=TRUE, fig.height=3}
sentiment_scores %>% 
  group_by(book) %>%
  summarize(score = sum(score)) %>% 
  mutate(book = as.factor(book)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(book, score)) + 
  geom_col(width = .8) + 
  labs(subtitle = "Total sentiment score by book",
       x = "Book number", y = "Total sentiment score") + 
  theme_ipsum() 
```

```{marginfigure echo=TRUE}
Since nearly every chapter in this book has a negative sentiment score, we will use negative values as an indicator of importance.
```

Edge betweenness centrality looks at the shortest paths through the network that go through each edge, and assigns each edge a value based on how much each edge "connects" the entire network.  Removing an edge with high edge betweenness centrality will greatly impact the entire network.
```{r fig.height=2.3}
as_tbl_graph(network_data, directed = FALSE) %>% 
  activate(edges) %>% 
  mutate(book = as.double(book), 
         chapter = as.integer(chapter)) %>% 
  mutate(importance = centrality_edge_betweenness()) %>% 
  as.tibble() %>% 
  select(book, chapter, importance) %>% 
  group_by(book, chapter) %>% 
  summarize(mean_importance = mean(importance)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  arrange(desc(mean_importance)) %>%
  left_join(sentiment_scores) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(score, mean_importance)) + 
  geom_point(size = .4) +
  labs(subtitle = "Centrality and sentiment by chapter", 
       x = "Total sentiment score", y = "Mean edge betweenness centrality") + 
  coord_flip() + 
  theme_ipsum() 
```

It appears that there is little to no correlation between a chapter's mean sentiment and mean edge betweenness centrality.
```{r fig.margin=TRUE, fig.keep='last', fig.height=3}
books %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, line) %>% 
  inner_join(get_sentiments("nrc")) %>% 
  count(sentiment) %>% 
  filter(sentiment != "positive" & sentiment != "negative") %>% 
  mutate(sentiment = str_to_title(sentiment)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(fct_reorder(sentiment, n), n)) + 
  geom_col(width = .8) + 
  geom_text(aes(label = formatC(n, format="d", big.mark=",")), hjust = -.1, 
            color = "grey20") + 
  labs(subtitle = "Most common emotions in Malazan", 
       x = "Emotion", y = "Count", 
       caption = "The NRC Word-Association Lexicon was\n used to identify the most often\n occuring emotions.") + 
  theme_ipsum(subtitle_size = 13) + 
  theme(axis.text.x=element_blank()) + 
  coord_flip()
no_clipping()

emotion_chapter <- books %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, line) %>% 
  inner_join(get_sentiments("nrc")) %>% 
  group_by(book, chapter, sentiment) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  filter(sentiment != "positive" & sentiment != "negative") %>% 
  arrange(book, chapter, desc(n)) %>% 
  group_by(book, chapter) %>% 
  mutate(rank = row_number(), 
         sentiment = str_to_title(sentiment)) %>% 
  filter(rank == 1) %>% 
  select(-rank, -n)
```

Now, I'm going to see if the mean edge betweenness centrality weighted with the total sentiment score of each chapter will find the major climaxes of each book. Note, the most common emotions weren't used to calculate sentiment scores or to find any of the climaxes. 

```{r}
importance_df <- as_tbl_graph(network_data, directed = FALSE) %>% 
  activate(edges) %>% 
  mutate(book = as.double(book), 
         chapter = as.integer(chapter)) %>% 
  mutate(importance = centrality_edge_betweenness()) %>% 
  as.tibble() %>% 
  select(book, chapter, importance) %>% 
  group_by(book, chapter) %>% 
  summarize(mean_importance = mean(importance)) %>% 
  ungroup()

importance_df %>% 
  left_join(sentiment_scores) %>% 
  mutate(importance_weighted = score * mean_importance) %>% 
  arrange(importance_weighted) %>% 
  group_by(book) %>% 
  mutate(rank =  row_number()) %>% 
  filter(rank == 1) %>% 
  select(book, chapter, mean_importance, score, importance_weighted) %>% 
  arrange(book) %>% 
  left_join(emotion_chapter) %>% 
  knitr::kable(col.names = c("Book", "Chapter", "Mean importance", "Sentiment score",
                             "Weighted importance", "Most common emotion")) 
```

While all of these chapters may be considered climaxes, I would say that only main climaxes are for books 5, 8, and 10. The interpretation of the "weighted importance" value, could be that these are the chapters with the largest negative impact on the series as a whole because many important characters are present and the chapters are very negative. If you read the series as a whole, this sounds quite plausible with the only exception being book 10, chapter 23. 

Lets look at only the mean edge betweenness centrality on its own. 

```{r}
importance_df %>% 
  arrange(desc(mean_importance)) %>% 
  group_by(book) %>% 
  mutate(rank = row_number()) %>% 
  filter(rank == 1) %>% 
  arrange(book) %>% 
  select(-rank) %>% 
  left_join(emotion_chapter) %>% 
  knitr::kable(col.names = c("Book", "Chapter", "Mean Importance", 
                             "Most common Emotion"))

# as_tbl_graph(network_data, directed = FALSE) %>% 
#   activate(edges) %>% 
#   filter(book == 9) %>% 
#   mutate(importance = centrality_edge_betweenness()) %>% 
#   as.tibble() %>% 
#   group_by(book, chapter) %>% 
#   summarize(mean_importance = mean(importance)) %>% 
#   arrange(desc(mean_importance))
```

```{marginfigure echo=TRUE}
Chapter summaries can be found here:
  
- Book 1: [**Gardens of the Moon**](https://malazan.fandom.com/wiki/Gardens_of_the_Moon/Dramatis_Personae)
- Book 2: [**Deadhouse Gates**](https://malazan.fandom.com/wiki/Deadhouse_Gates/Dramatis_Personae)
- Book 3: [**Memories of Ice**](https://malazan.fandom.com/wiki/Memories_of_Ice/Dramatis_Personae)
- Book 4: [**House of Chains**](https://malazan.fandom.com/wiki/House_of_Chains/Dramatis_Personae)
- Book 5: [**Midnight Tides**](https://malazan.fandom.com/wiki/Midnight_Tides/Dramatis_Personae)
- Book 6: [**The Bonehunters**](https://malazan.fandom.com/wiki/The_Bonehunters/Dramatis_Personae)
- Book 7: [**Reaper's Gale**](https://malazan.fandom.com/wiki/Reaper%27s_Gale/Dramatis_Personae)
- Book 8: [**Toll the Hounds**](https://malazan.fandom.com/wiki/Toll_the_Hounds/Dramatis_Personae)
- Book 9: [**Dust of Dreams**](https://malazan.fandom.com/wiki/Dust_of_Dreams/Dramatis_Personae)
- Book 10: [**The Crippled God**](https://malazan.fandom.com/wiki/The_Crippled_God/Dramatis_Personae)
```

The only main climax here is for Book 8, but the chapters for books 5 and 8 could be considered sub-climaxes. So just plain edge betweenness centrality doesn't quite work for finding the climaxes of each book. Book 2, chapter 1 just has a lot of dialogue between important characters, but I don't think it can be considered a climax of any degree. These are the chapters that have the highest mean edge centrality, meaning that the average edge has the highest edge betweenness centrality. 

What about only using sentiment scores? 

```{r}
sentiment_scores %>% 
  arrange(score) %>% 
  group_by(book) %>% 
  mutate(rank = row_number()) %>% 
  filter(rank == 1) %>% 
  select(-rank) %>% 
  arrange(book) %>% 
  left_join(emotion_chapter) %>% 
  knitr::kable(col.names = c("Book", "Chapter", "Sentiment score", 
                             "Most common emotion"))
```

Well this appears to be the best metric by far for finding climaxes. A conclusion that can easily be drawn from this is that the most negative part of each book tends to be the climax of the book in this series and the most frequently occurring emotion in these chapters is "Fear". Some of these chapters have major battles, revolutions, and a couple horribly morbid chapters. Books 3, 5, 7, 8, and 10 all have what I believe are the main climaxes in their respective books, and Books 2, 4, 6, and 15 are all sub-climaxes. 

```{marginfigure echo=TRUE}
Emotions in the NRC Lexicon:\newline
- Fear\newline
- Trust\newline
- Sadness\newline
- Anger\newline
- Anticipation \newline
- Joy\newline
- Disgust\newline
- Surprise\newline
```

While simple positive and negative sentiment scores are the best metrics for finding the climax of each book, all of these methods pick out some very interesting chapters.

# Appendices
##Co-occurrence extraction
In this section, I'll include some snippets of the code that I used to extract the co-occurrence data from the books. 

The books were in this format, in a single data.frame, after being loaded into R and doing some pre-processing:

```{marginfigure echo=TRUE}
The book pre-processing code can be found here: \newline
https://github.com/visuelledata/malazannetwork/blob/master/R/import_books.R
```

------

```{r}
books %>% 
  head(7)
```

------

Starting with data in the ngram format below. 

------

```{r}
books %>% 
  standardize_names_book() %>% 
  group_by(book, chapter) %>% 
  unnest_tokens(ngram, line, token = "ngrams", n = 20, to_lower = FALSE) %>%
  head(10)
```

I then broke the ngram data into 10 separate lists, 1 for each book, each list contained a separate data frame for each chapter. I'll leave this output out as it will be too long.

\newpage 

Below is the main function I used to extract the co-occurrence data: 

------

```{r eval=FALSE, collapse=FALSE, cache=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(future.apply)

process_data <- function(datastuff, book_num, chap_num){
  tictoc::tic() # For execution time
  plan(multiprocess, workers = 4) # To set parallelization parameters
  
  # Pulls out the co-occurrence data
  placeholder <- datastuff %>%
    future_apply(1, function(x){ # future_apply applies the map function to each row 
                      map_chr(all_names, # map_chr plugs each name into the below func
                        function(pat){
                          name <- str_extract(x, pattern = fixed(pat)) # Finds the name
                          #The line below removes any matches from the string
                          if(!is.na(name)) x <<- str_remove(x, pattern = fixed(pat)) 
                          name # So the function returns the co-occurrence data
                         }
                        )
                      },
                 future.seed = TRUE) # Outputs a matrix
  
  # Formats the data into a "tidy" format and does some basic cleaning
  placeholder %>% 
    t() %>% # Transposes matrix
    as.tibble() %>% # Converts it to a data frame
    unite("names", V1:V3080, sep = ";") %>% # Makes all 3,080 columns into a single one
    remove_NAs() %>% # Removes all of the NAs that were generated, leaves only names
    mutate(book = book_num, # Adds book and chapter data
           chapter = chap_num) %>%  
    write_rds(paste0("data/network_data/network_data", # Writes a file for each chapter
                     book_num, "-", chap_num,   
                     ".rds"), 
              compress = "none")
  
  tictoc::toc() # Gets execution time
  return(NULL)
}
```

\newpage
The `process_data()` function is then ran in 10 different for loops, one per book, that iterate over the chapters to write `rds` files containing all of the co-occurrence data. One for loop is shown below. 

------

```{r eval=FALSE, collapse=FALSE, cache=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
for (i in seq_along(book1)){
  process_data(book1[[i]], book_num = 1, chap_num = i) 
}
```
